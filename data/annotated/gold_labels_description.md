# Gold Label Definition

Each poem in the dataset is annotated with a single gold-standard poetic meter.

Meter labels are defined at the poem level, based on dominant metrical patterns.
In ambiguous cases, the label is determined by majority pattern occurrence.

Annotations are produced through a combination of:
- manual annotation
- API-assisted annotation
- cross-validation between sources

This file documents the annotation principles and decision rules.
